# binary_search_tree

I was required to implement binary search tree, Driver.cpp, BST.cpp, BST.h, 
TreeNode.h files and this program should: Delete, Insert, search for an element in the tree, negate the tree in preorder, 
inorder and postorder fashion and print the contents of the tree in preorder function. 
The TreeNode.h should include some definitions of the class constructor and functions to avoid create Treenode.cpp. file. 
I explore, insert, delete and show functions, private functions for inorder, preorder and postorder traversals.
